## FAQ Section
**Badge:** Frequently Asked Questions

**Headline:** Got Questions? We've Got Answers

**Subheadline:** Everything you need to know about automating your content

**FAQs:**
1. **How is this different from Buffer or Hootsuite?**
   Those are scheduling tools - you still create all the content. We're an AI content creation system that generates, designs, and publishes everything automatically. You upload once, we create endless variations.

2. **Will the content sound robotic or generic?**
   No. Our AI learns your brand voice and style. Each post is unique, on-brand, and engaging. You can review and edit anything before it goes live, or let it run fully automated.

3. **What if I don't have any content to start with?**
   No problem! We can work with just your website URL, product descriptions, or even just a brief about your business. Our AI creates original content from minimal input.

4. **Can I review posts before they go live?**
   Absolutely. You can choose full automation, approval mode (review everything), or smart mode (auto-approve certain types, review others). It's completely flexible.

5. **How long does setup take?**
   The free demo takes 60 seconds. Full setup takes about 2-3 hours of your time spread over a few days. After that, it runs forever without you.

6. **What platforms do you support?**
   Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Facebook, TikTok, and Pinterest. We're adding YouTube Shorts and Threads soon. Everything posts from one upload.

7. **Is there a contract or can I cancel anytime?**
   No contracts, cancel anytime. We offer a 7-day free trial and a 30-day money-back guarantee. We're confident you'll love it.

8. **How much content can you generate?**
   Our Growth plan includes unlimited posts. Most clients post 1-2 times per day per platform. The AI can generate hundreds of variations from a single upload.
