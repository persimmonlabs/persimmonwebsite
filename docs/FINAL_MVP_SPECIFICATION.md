# Final MVP Specification - Persimmon Labs Demo Generator

## Executive Summary
A demo funnel that generates 7 posts, 3 graphics, and 1 sourced industry insight in <90 seconds. No magic claims, no unsourced stats, no auto-scraping. Just provable value delivered fast.

## Core Promise
**Input:** Brand name, email, industry, website (optional), competitor handle (optional), primary color hex
**Output in <90 seconds:** 7 platform-specific posts + 3 simple graphics + 1 sourced insight + downloadable assets

## Architecture

### Stack
- **Orchestrator:** n8n workflow engine
- **LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (capped at 3.7k tokens/demo)
- **Graphics:** HTML-to-image via Puppeteer (warm pool)
- **Storage:** Supabase (insights DB + asset storage)
- **Email:** SendGrid
- **Calendar:** Google Sheets API

### Data Flow
```
Webhook ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Load Industry Pack ‚Üí Parallel LLM Calls ‚Üí Graphics Generation ‚Üí PDF Assembly ‚Üí Asset Storage ‚Üí Email Delivery
```

## Deliverables (Non-Negotiable)

### Content Package
1. **7 Platform-Specific Posts** (120-250 words each)
   - 3 LinkedIn (professional tone)
   - 2 Instagram (casual, emoji-rich)
   - 2 Twitter (punchy, thread-ready)

2. **3 Simple Graphics** (1080x1080, watermarked)
   - Quote card (brand color background + text)
   - Stats graphic (sourced number + visual)
   - Swipe carousel cover ("5 Ways to...")

3. **1 Killer Insight** (with source)
   - Format: "LinkedIn posts with 'I was wrong about' get 3.4x engagement [Source: Benchmark study, Jan 2024]"
   - If no live data: Use precomputed industry benchmark clearly labeled

4. **1 Viral Hook Template**
   - Industry-specific from vetted library
   - Example: "The [Industry] truth nobody talks about..."

5. **Downloadable Assets**
   - PDF with all content + sources + method notes
   - Google Sheet calendar link
   - ZIP of PNG graphics

## Critical Constraints

### Intelligence Claims
- **NO unsourced statistics** - Every number must have a link or "Industry Benchmark" label
- **NO competitor scraping** - Only use provided handles for public metadata
- **NO algorithmic guarantees** - Frame as "patterns we observe"
- **NO hallucinated insights** - Use precomputed tables when live data unavailable

### Technical SLAs
- **Target:** <90 seconds (not 47-60)
- **Graceful degradation:** Queue message at 90s, deliver by 3 minutes
- **Error handling:** If graphics fail, deliver text-only version
- **Reliability target:** 80% under 90s, <5% hard failures

### Cost Reality
- **Per demo:** $0.10-0.25 (not $0.05)
- **Breakdown:**
  - LLM: $0.04-0.12
  - Graphics processing: $0.02
  - Email/storage: $0.01
  - Infrastructure: $0.03-0.10

### Legal/Trust
- **Require hex colors** - No auto-extraction from websites
- **Sources footnote** - Every stat links to origin
- **Watermarks** - "DEMO MODE" on all graphics
- **ToS compliance** - No unauthorized scraping
- **Moderation** - Banned topics list + brand safety check

## Precomputed Intelligence System

  "trending_hashtags": ["#SaaS", "#B2B", "#StartupLife"],
  "source": "Analysis of 10,000 posts, Week of Jan 20, 2024",
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

### Viral Hook Library
```javascript
// Vetted templates by industry
{
  "SaaS": [
    "I was wrong about [common belief]",
    "Stop doing [old way]. Start doing [new way]",
    "The $[number] [industry] mistake everyone makes"

### Source Policy
```javascript
if (stat.source) {
  return `${stat.value} [Source: ${stat.source}]`
} else if (stat.isBenchmark) {
  return `${stat.value} [Industry Benchmark, Updated: ${date}]`
} else {
  // Don't output the stat at all
  return null
}
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
try {
  // Generate content
} catch (LLMError) {
  // Use precomputed templates
} catch (GraphicsError) {
  // Deliver text-only version
} catch (CriticalError) {
  // Queue for manual review
  // Send apology email with 30-min SLA
}
```

## Pricing Strategy

- ‚ùå Competitor content scraping
- ‚ùå Perfect brand matching

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **LLM latency:** Parallel calls + timeout at 30s per call
- **Graphics failure:** Text-only fallback
- **API limits:** Queue system + rate limiting

### Business Risks
- **Trust:** Every stat has a source or benchmark label
- **Legal:** No scraping, clear ToS, moderation
- **Quality:** Precomputed templates as fallback
